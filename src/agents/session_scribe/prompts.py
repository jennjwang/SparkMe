<instructions>

## Process:
1. Analyze the user's response to identify important information:
   - Split long responses into MULTIPLE coherent parts.
     * Each memory should cover one part of the user's direct response.
     * Together, all memories should cover the ENTIRE user's response.
   - For EACH piece of information worth storing:
     * Create a concise but descriptive title.
     * Summarize the information clearly.
     * Add relevant metadata (e.g., topics, emotions, when, where, who, etc.).
     * Identify ALL relevant subtopics from the provided topics list.
     * For each relevant subtopic, rate its importance (1-10) and explain relevance.

2. Linking and coverage:
   - Each memory can relate to MULTIPLE subtopics.
   - Use `subtopic_links` as a list of objects, where each object contains:
     * `subtopic_id`: ID from <topics_list>
     * `importance`: 1-10 score for how critical this memory is to THIS subtopic
     * `relevance`: Brief explanation of why this memory matters to THIS subtopic
   - Importance scoring guide:
     * 9-10: Core, defining information for this subtopic
     * 7-8: Highly relevant, adds significant depth
     * 5-6: Moderately relevant, provides context
     * 3-4: Tangentially related, minor detail
     * 1-2: Barely relevant, mentioned in passing
   - Do NOT invent subtopic_ids; only use ones explicitly listed in <topics_list>.
   - A single memory should link to multiple subtopics when the information is relevant to multiple areas.

3. Skip all tool calls if the response:
   - Contains no meaningful information,
   - Is just greetings or ice-breakers,
   - Shows user deflection or non-answers.
</instructions>
"""

<output_format>
<thinking>
1. Analyze Response Content:
   - Is this response worth storing? (Skip if just greetings/deflections)
   - How should I split this response into meaningful segments?
     * Look for natural breaks in topics, experiences, or time periods.
     * Each split should be a complete, coherent thought.
   
2. Multi-Subtopic Relevance Analysis:
   For each memory segment:
   - Which subtopics does this information relate to?
   - For EACH relevant subtopic:
     * How important is this memory for understanding THAT subtopic? (1-10)
     * Why does this memory matter to THAT subtopic specifically?
   - Example reasoning:
     "User worked at Google for 5 years on LLM team"
     → career_history (importance: 9) - Core career experience defining professional background
     → technical_expertise (importance: 7) - LLM team indicates AI/ML skills
     → company_culture (importance: 4) - Google experience provides work environment context

3. Coverage Check:
   - Have I captured all key experiences, events, and opinions?
   - For each memory, have I identified ALL relevant subtopics (not just the primary one)?
   - Are importance scores differentiated across subtopics (same memory can have different importance)?
   - Do the subtopic links collectively cover the full semantic space of the response?

# Session Agenda Update
## Process:
1. Focus ONLY on the most recent user message in the conversation history
2. Review existing session agenda, paying attention to:
   - Which questions are marked as "Answered"
   - What information is already captured in existing notes

## Guidelines for Adding Notes:
- Only process information from the latest user message
- Skip questions marked as "Answered" - do not add more notes to them
- Only add information that:
  - Answers previously unanswered questions
  - Provides significant new details for partially answered questions
  - Contains valuable information not related to any existing questions

## Adding Notes:
For each piece of new information worth storing:
1. Use the update_session_agenda tool
2. Include:
   - [ID] tag with question number for relevant questions
   - Leave ID empty for valuable information not tied to specific questions
3. Write concise, fact-focused notes. The notes should capture specific, professional details.
   - **Good Example:** "User has 5 years of experience with Python, primarily using Pandas and Scikit-learn for data analysis in Project X."
   - **Bad Example:** "User seems to like Python."
   - **Good Example:** "Managed a team of 4 engineers and delivered the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule."
   - **Bad Example:** "User is a good manager."

## Tool Usage:
- Make separate update_session_agenda calls for each distinct piece of new information
- Skip if:
  - The question is marked as "Answered"
  - The information is already captured in existing notes
  - No new information is found in the latest message

CONSIDER_AND_PROPOSE_FOLLOWUPS_INSTRUCTIONS = """
<instructions>
# Question Development Process

## Step 1: Evaluate Available Information
1.  **Review the Current Topic**: Understand the objective of the current Core Topic provided in `<current_topic_info>`.
2.  **Review the Last Q&A**: Carefully review the user's most recent response.

Now decide:
- Do you need more context about the experience? → Use the recall tool
- Do you have enough context but the users' response to the question requires more detail? → Consider proposing follow-up questions for the recent response
- Do you have enough context and the users' response to the question were detail? → Consider proposing follow-up questions based on the current topic

## Step 2: Choose Your Action
Based on your analysis, choose **ONE** of the following actions.

### Action A: Use the Recall Tool
- **When to use:** If you don't have enough context to formulate a good, new question, or you want to check if a piece of information has already been mentioned.
- **How to use:** 
    1. Call the `recall` tool with a specific query related to the current topic.
    2. Focus searches on the current topic and related themes.
    3. Make your search specific to the experience being discussed.
    4. No need to move on to step 3 until you have gathered sufficient context.

### Action B: If you have sufficient context, analyze:
- Recent conversation and user's answers
- Memory recall results
- Existing questions in session agenda
- Previous questions asked in conversation
- Questions already marked as answered
- What kind of metric that makes the question more objective and comparable.

## Step 3: Propose Questions

IMPORTANT: Skip this section if using the recall tool.

If conditions are NOT right for follow-ups:
- Current response has been complete, OR
- Topic already thoroughly explored, that is further questions would not deepen understanding of user's AI-in-workforce perspective
→ Action: End without proposing questions

If conditions ARE right for follow-ups:
→ Action: Propose either a "Drill-Down" sub-question or a new top-level question revolving the current topic, by following these guidelines:

### Action B.1. Propose a "Drill-Down" Sub-Question
**When to use:**  
- The last answer was interesting but lacked specific detail, OR  
- The user mentioned something worth clarifying or elaborating.  

**How to use:**  
1. Ask for more detail about a *specific part* of the last answer.  
2. Set the `parent_id` to the question just answered.  
3. Create a new `question_id` as a child of that parent (e.g., `topic_id-1.2.1`).  
4. Quantify your question with a rubric or metric whenever it fits naturally and adds clarity.

**Types of Drill-Down Questions:**  
- **Fact-Gathering:** Basic details still missing (setting, people, frequency, scope).  
  - Example: *"Who else was involved in that project?"*  
  - Example: *"How often did those meetings take place?"*  
- **Deeper Exploration:** Memorable moments, relationships, challenges, or turning points.  
  - Example: *"What was the most challenging part of working with that new tool?"*  
  - Example: *"How did your team react when AI was introduced into that process?"*  

### Action B.2: Propose a New Top-Level Question (within the same topic)
**When to use:**  
- The last answer was complete and that line of questioning is finished.  
- It's time to move to the next angle within the current core topic.  

**How to use:**  
1. Review the overall topic in `<questions_and_notes>` and the topic description in `<current_topic_info>`.
2. Identify the next logical, unanswered question that would help fulfill the topic's objective.
3. Call the `add_interview_question` tool.
4. Do **not** provide a `parent_id`.
5. Quantify your question with a rubric or metric whenever it fits naturally and adds clarity.
6. Create a new top-level `question_id` for the current topic (e.g., if the last question was `topic_id-2.3`, the new one is `topic_id-2.4`).
- **Example:**
   - Last Question Answered (ID `job_experience-1.3`): "What was the outcome of Project Phoenix?"
   - Your New Question (ID `job_experience-1.4`): "What was the biggest lesson you learned from working on that project?"

## General Question Guidelines
- Builds naturally on the current conversation.
- Use direct "you/your" address.
- Focus on specific experiences and avoid abstract questions.
- Explores genuinely new information.
- Follow parent-child ID structure.
- Quantify your question with a rubric or metric whenever it fits naturally and adds clarity.
- Avoid:
  * Questions similar to ones already in session agenda
  * Questions already asked in conversation
  * Questions marked as answered
  * Unrelated topics
  * Abstract questions
  * Redundant questions

## Duplicate Question Prevention:**
**Do Not Propose Questions That Are:**
1. Similar to Existing Questions
   - Check current session agenda in `<questions_and_notes>`
   - Review for similar content or intent

2. Already Asked in Conversation
   - Review conversation history in `<event_stream>`
   - Check for questions with similar meaning or focus

3. Previously Considered and Rejected
   - Review your past decisions in `<event_stream>`
   - Avoid questions you previously determined were not suitable

- Maximum depth allowed is 4 levels (e.g., topic_id-1.2.3.4)

       * Fully covered when the main question or theme is explained with sufficient clarity, logic, and completeness (even if not quantifiable).
       * However, if notes is already comprehensive, feel free to mark it as covered as there are more important subtopics to be covered in later section.

3. **Aggregation**
   - For fully covered subtopics, synthesize the notes into a coherent and concise final summary capturing the essence of what was discussed.
   - Avoid repetition or rephrasing—focus on integration and clarity.

4. **Tool Invocation (Fully Covered)**
   - Only call `update_subtopic_coverage` for subtopics that are fully covered.
   - Each call should include:
       * `subtopic_id`: the ID of the covered subtopic.
       * `aggregated_notes`: the aggregated summary notes.

## Process
1. Read the topics and subtopics in `topics_list`.
2. Read the user's *most recent message* or *additional_context* carefully. Use the last meeting summary and previous events only as supporting background.
3. Decide whether you can think of some NEW emergent subtopics to be added to the interview agenda that have not yet covered by current topics and subtopics listed.
4. Add exactly one emergent subtopic—the strongest candidate—or none.

## Decision rules (apply strictly)
- The idea must fall *within one of the existing topics* and *not related to any existing subtopics*. If it does not clearly map to a parent topic, do NOT add it.
- The idea must be *novel*: the idea of emergence topic is uncommon, so if it can reasonably be addressed within any existing subtopic (even loosely), do NOT add it.
- If multiple candidate ideas appear, select **only the strongest single candidate**.
- If no candidate satisfies all rules, do not add any new subtopic.

## Ranking heuristic for choosing the strongest candidate
Score each candidate based on:
  Score = Novelty x Expected Information Gain x Direct Relevance
Where:
- Novelty = how meaningfully different it is from all existing subtopics.
- Expected Information Gain = how likely a follow-up question on this idea would yield new, useful insights.
- Direct Relevance = how clearly the idea aligns with its parent topic.

## Practical checks
- The emergent subtopic description should be short, clear, and represent an idea (5-10 words, maximum 1 sentence).
- Avoid redundancy, rephrasings, or overly narrow micro-subtopics.
- Do not add subtopics that drift outside the interview's intended scope.

## Examples
- If existing subtopics include "evaluation metrics" and "benchmark selection," and the user mentions "error patterns across languages," treat it as emergent *only if* it cannot reasonably fit under "evaluation."
- If the user suggests "testing on dataset X" but a "datasets" subtopic already exists, do NOT add a new subtopic.

<thinking>
Step-by-step reasoning (each step as a separate numbered line):
1. Identify candidate emergent idea(s) mentioned in the most recent message to be added as NOVEL subtopic to the current topics and subtopics list (explicitly list them or state "none"). If most recent message is empty, consider additional context or last meeting's summary.
2. Come up with this emergent idea(s) in 5-10 words, maximum 1 sentence.
3. For the selected candidate, review ALL listed topic along with their associated subtopics, and identify the topic ID under which this novel emergent subtopic best fits.
4. Explain, in one short sentence, why this candidate is NOVEL and cannot be reasonably grouped under any existing subtopic, especially since 'emergence' is uncommon.
5. Explain, in one short sentence, why this candidate is the strongest among candidates (use the ranking heuristic: Novelty x Expected Information Gain x Direct Relevance).
6. Conclude with a one-line decision: either "add" or "no_add" and a one-line justification.

IDENTIFY_EMERGENT_INSIGHTS_INSTRUCTIONS = """
<instructions>

Your task is to analyze the **current interviewer-user Q&A exchange** and determine whether it contains any **emergent insights**.

An emergent insight is:
- Counter-intuitive or unexpected within the typical answer on a particular subtopic
- Contradicts or challenges common or conventional beliefs
- Reveals a novel pattern or behavior not captured by existing work
- **Not already covered by previously observed emergent insights**
- Grounded in the user's stated experience (not speculation or hypotheticals)

Emergent insights are **uncommon**. Do NOT force them.

## Novelty Scoring (use strictly)

Use an **integer novelty score from 1 to 5**:

- **5**: Highly counter-intuitive; challenges core assumptions or norms
- **4**: Clearly unexpected; reveals a strong new perspective
- **3**: Moderately novel; interesting deviation from standard practice
- **1-2**: Mild or unsurprising; NOT emergent (do not report)

## Analysis Procedure

1. Analyze the current Q&A exchange.
2. Review relevant topics, subtopics, and previously observed emergent insights.
3. Determine whether any **new and distinct** emergent insight is present.
4. For each valid emergent insight:
   - Identify the most relevant **subtopic_id**
   - Write a concise **description**
   - Assign a **novelty_score (1-5)**
   - Write a concise **evidence** of this emergence
   - State the **conventional belief** the insight contradicts
