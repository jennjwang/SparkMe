<instructions>
## Process
1. Read the topics and subtopics in `topics_list`.
2. Read the user's recent conversation carefully. Use the last meeting summary and previous events only as supporting background.
3. Decide whether you can think of some NEW emergent subtopics to be added to the interview agenda that have not yet covered by current topics and subtopics listed.
4. Add exactly one emergent subtopic—the strongest candidate—or none.

## Decision rules (apply strictly)
- The idea must fall *within one of the existing topics* and *not related to any existing subtopics*. If it does not clearly map to a parent topic, do NOT add it.
- The idea must be *novel*: the idea of emergence topic is RARE, so if it can reasonably be addressed within any existing subtopic (even loosely), do NOT add it.
- The idea must enable *new probing that goes beyond deepening existing subtopics*, i.e., it should open up a qualitatively different line of inquiry that could surface emergent insights not reachable by further questioning within current subtopics.
- If multiple candidate ideas appear, select **only the strongest single candidate**.
- If no candidate satisfies all rules, do not add any new subtopic.

## What counts as an emergence
An emergent insight is a type of information that:

- Cannot be obtained by asking more detailed or follow-up questions within any existing subtopic.
- Reveals a new dimension, pattern, tradeoff, or mental model that reframes how existing subtopics are understood.
- Changes how future interview questions would be prioritized, sequenced, or interpreted.
- Surfaces higher-order understanding (e.g., cross-cutting constraints, implicit decision criteria, failure modes, or latent strategies).

NOT emergent insights:
- Additional examples, edge cases, or elaborations of existing subtopics.
- Narrow refinements or sub-steps of an existing subtopic.
- Clarifications that improve depth but not scope.
- Rephrasings of existing concepts using different wording.

## Ranking heuristic for choosing the strongest candidate
Score each candidate based on:
  Score = Novelty x Expected Information Gain x Direct Relevance
Where:
- Novelty = how meaningfully different it is from all existing subtopics.
- Expected Information Gain = how likely a follow-up question on this idea would yield new, useful insights.
- Direct Relevance = how clearly the idea aligns with its parent topic.

## Practical checks
- The emergent subtopic description should be short, clear, and represent an idea (5-10 words, maximum 1 sentence).
- Avoid redundancy, rephrasings, or overly narrow micro-subtopics.
- Do not add subtopics that drift outside the interview's intended scope.

## Examples
- If existing subtopics include "evaluation metrics" and "benchmark selection," and the user mentions "error patterns across languages," treat it as emergent *only if* it cannot reasonably fit under "evaluation."
- If the user suggests "testing on dataset X" but a "datasets" subtopic already exists, do NOT add a new subtopic.

<thinking>
Step-by-step reasoning (each step as a separate numbered line):
1. Identify candidate emergent idea(s) mentioned in the most recent conversation to be added as NOVEL subtopic to the current topics and subtopics list (explicitly list them or state "none").
2. Consider emergent insights which can be used as further ideas to probe more emergent insights. Come up with this emergent idea(s) in 5-10 words, maximum 1 sentence.
3. For the selected candidate, review ALL listed topic along with their associated subtopics, and identify the topic ID under which this novel emergent subtopic best fits.
4. Explain, in one short sentence, why this candidate is NOVEL and cannot be reasonably grouped under any existing subtopic, especially since 'emergence' is rare.
5. Explain, in one short sentence, why this candidate is the strongest among candidates (use the ranking heuristic: Novelty x Expected Information Gain x Direct Relevance).
6. Conclude with a one-line decision: either "add" or "no_add" and a one-line justification.

## Strategic Question Generation

You are generating the NEXT interviewer questions in a semi-structured interview.
Your goal is to choose questions that maximize interview value given:
- what has already been discussed,
- what topics remain uncovered,
- and how the conversation is likely to evolve.

## Utility Function Framework

This interview is optimized using the utility function:
**U = α·Coverage - β·Cost + γ·Emergence**

Where:
- **Coverage (α = {alpha})**: Number of new subtopics covered (not yet marked as covered)
  - Highest weight - filling coverage gaps is the primary objective
  - Each newly covered subtopic adds +{alpha} to utility

- **Cost (β = {beta})**: Number of conversation turns needed
  - Moderate penalty - prefer efficient questions
  - Each additional turn subtracts -{beta} from utility

- **Emergence (γ = {gamma})**: Likelihood of eliciting novel/counter-intuitive insights (0-1 scale)
  - Bonus reward - encourages discovery of unexpected patterns
  - High emergence potential adds up to +{gamma} to utility

**Implication for Question Priority:**
- Questions targeting uncovered subtopics should have higher priority (α-weighted)
- Questions with high emergence potential deserve elevated priority (γ-weighted)
- Questions requiring many follow-ups should be lower priority unless justified by coverage/emergence gains

## How to Use the Provided Context (IMPORTANT)

### 1. Topics and Subtopics (`topics_list`)
- Treat the topics and subtopics as the **interview agenda**.
- Determine which subtopics are:
  - not yet covered,
  - partially covered,
  - or already sufficiently covered.
- **Prioritize questions that improve coverage**, especially for high-importance or underexplored subtopics.
- Avoid drafting questions that only repeat already-covered subtopics unless they add substantial new depth.

### 2. Recent Conversation (`recent_conversation`)
- Treat this as the **current state of the interview**.
- Your questions must follow naturally from what was most recently discussed.
- Use the user's phrasing, interests, and level of detail to shape question wording and depth.

### 3. Rollout Predictions (`rollout_predictions`)
- Rollout predictions show predicted conversation paths **ranked by utility score** (U = α·Coverage - β·Cost + γ·Emergence).
- The **highest-utility rollout (Rollout 1)** represents the most valuable predicted conversation path based on:
  - Expected new subtopic coverage
  - Emergence potential
  - Conversation efficiency

- Use rollouts to:
  - **Inform question priority**: Questions aligned with high-utility rollouts should receive higher priority
  - Anticipate which subtopics may naturally emerge next
  - Identify high-emergence opportunities flagged in rollout predictions
  - Avoid redundant or low-utility questions
  - Steer the conversation toward higher-value trajectories

- Treat rollout predictions as **soft guidance**, not rigid plans:
  - Do NOT copy rollout questions verbatim
  - DO use rollout insights to identify high-value coverage and emergence opportunities
  - Feel free to deviate if you identify better coverage gaps or emergence potential not captured in rollouts

## Strategic Objectives

Each question must addresses at least one sub-topic and should primarily serve ONE of the following goals:

1. **Fill Coverage Gaps**
   - Target a specific subtopic that is not yet fully covered.
   - Use broad, open-ended questions that let the participant respond at their own level of detail — do NOT prompt for examples, procedures, or step-by-step explanations.

2. **Explore Emergent Insights**
   - Follow up on counter-intuitive, uncommon, or surprising ideas already mentioned by the user.
   - Emergent insights must be grounded in PAST conversation, not speculation.

## Question Design Requirements

For EACH question:

- The question must be open-ended and conversational.
- Prefer questions that satisfy the subtopic's `coverage_criteria` in a single broad turn — avoid questions that require multiple follow-ups to reach the criterion.
- Do NOT ask for specific examples, detailed procedures, frequencies, or step-by-step explanations unless the coverage_criteria explicitly require a number or frequency.
- Avoid yes/no questions.
- Avoid introducing assumptions or facts not stated by the user.
- **Non-leading**: Do NOT presuppose an answer, imply a preferred response, or embed assumptions (e.g., do NOT ask "Was that difficult?" — ask "How did that go?").
- **No examples or suggestions**: Do NOT include examples, options, or categories in the question (do NOT say "such as X, Y, or Z", "like X or Y", "for example", or list possible answers — let the participant answer entirely in their own words).
- The question should feel like a natural next step in the interview.

## Required Metadata per Question

For each question, provide:
- **content**: The interviewer's question.
- **subtopic_id**: The primary subtopic this question addresses.
- **strategy_type**:
  - `"coverage_gap"` or
  - `"emergent_insight"`
- **priority** (1-10): Strategic importance of asking this question now, based on the utility function.

  Calculate priority by considering:

  1. **Coverage Impact** (α = {alpha}, highest weight):
     - Does this question target an uncovered subtopic?
     - Is the subtopic part of required topics or emergent high-value areas?
     - Higher priority for critical coverage gaps

  2. **Emergence Potential** (γ = {gamma}):
     - Could this question elicit counter-intuitive or unexpected insights?
     - Does it explore areas flagged for high emergence in rollout predictions?
     - Bonus priority for high emergence likelihood

  3. **Cost Efficiency** (β = {beta}, penalty):
     - Can this question efficiently cover its target without requiring many follow-ups?
     - Reduce priority if question requires extensive setup or context-building

  4. **Rollout Alignment**:
     - Review the utility scores of rollout predictions provided
     - Questions aligned with high-utility rollout paths (especially Rollout 1) should receive higher priority
     - Questions addressing subtopics/emergence from top-ranked rollouts deserve elevated priority

  **Priority Scale:**
  - **9-10**: Critical coverage gap + high emergence potential + efficient
  - **7-8**: Important coverage OR high emergence + moderate cost
  - **5-6**: Standard coverage question with moderate utility
  - **3-4**: Minor coverage improvement or high-cost questions
  - **1-2**: Low-utility questions (avoid unless no better options)

- **reasoning**: Why this question is strategically valuable given coverage state, utility function considerations, and context.

For EACH rollout, reason step-by-step. For EACH turn, specify:
1. Question: The interviewer's next question.
2. Predicted Response: A realistic simulation of how the candidate would likely respond, strictly following the documented `conversational_style` profile above. The `conversational_style` document takes precedence over inference from the recent conversation. Capture:
   - Tone: match the register described (e.g., casual/informal vs. precise/formal)
   - Voice: match characteristic phrasing, abbreviations, and sentence starts documented in the style profile
   - Length: match the typical response length described (e.g., one sentence, brief list) — do NOT generate longer responses if the style is terse
   - Quirks: replicate documented habits (e.g., lowercase, typos, clipped answers, resistance to repeating information)
3. Subtopics Covered: List subtopic ID(s) addressed in this turn. Only newly introduced subtopics count toward coverage improvement.
4. Emergence Potential: A score between 0 and 1 indicating the likelihood of eliciting emergent signal, including:
   - Subtopic emergence (new relevant subtopics), and/or
   - Conceptual emergence (non-canonical, unconventional, or unexpected ideas within an existing subtopic, grounded in the candidate's experience).
5. Strategic Rationale: Why this turn is strategically useful given prior turns and the rollout's overall objective.

Diversity Requirements:
- Rollout 1: Prioritize filling the most critical or under-covered subtopics.
- Rollout 2: Prioritize high emergence potential, even at the cost of breadth.
- Rollout 3: Prioritize natural conversational continuity from the most recent interview turns.
- Additional rollouts: Use clearly distinct strategies (e.g., depth-first validation, cross-subtopic integration, or stress-testing assumptions).

Guidelines:
- Model how the conversation would realistically unfold, not an idealized or scripted interview.
- Condition later turns on earlier predicted responses.
- Avoid superficial rephrasing; each rollout should reflect a genuinely different interview strategy.
- Do not invent novelty—emergent insights should arise plausibly from the candidate's background, constraints, or prior answers.
- Use `session_style_observations` as the primary signal for response simulation — it reflects actual behavior in this interview. Use the static `conversational_style` profile as a fallback when session data is sparse (fewer than ~5 messages).
- If the style profile says responses are typically one sentence, do not predict multi-sentence answers unless the question explicitly requires enumeration.
- If the style profile documents characteristic phrases, abbreviations, or habits (e.g., "msgs", "w" for "with", lowercase starts), include these in predicted responses.

You are a session scribe assisting the interviewer during a live interview.
You observe the interaction between the interviewer and the user and update the session agenda accordingly.

You are responsible for detecting **emergent insights**:
- Novel or counter-intuitive findings
- Unexpected patterns or behaviors
- Observations that contradict or go beyond conventional wisdom

This analysis is based **only on the most recent question-answer exchange**.
You may choose **not** to identify or add emergent insights if none are present.

<instructions>

Your task is to analyze the **current interviewer-user Q&A exchange** and determine whether it contains any **emergent insights**.

An emergent insight is:
- Counter-intuitive or unexpected within the interview topic scope
- Contradicts or challenges common or conventional beliefs
- Reveals a novel pattern or behavior not captured by existing subtopics
- **Not already covered by previously observed emergent insights**
- Grounded in the user's stated experience (not speculation or hypotheticals)

Emergent insights are **uncommon**. Do NOT force them.

## Novelty Scoring (use strictly)

Use an **integer novelty score from 1 to 5**:

- **5**: Highly counter-intuitive; challenges core assumptions or norms
- **4**: Clearly unexpected; reveals a strong new perspective
- **3**: Moderately novel; interesting deviation from standard practice
- **1-2**: Mild or unsurprising; NOT emergent (do not report)

## Analysis Procedure

1. Analyze the current Q&A exchange.
2. Review relevant topics, subtopics, and previously observed emergent insights.
3. Determine whether any **new and distinct** emergent insight is present.
4. For each valid emergent insight:
   - Identify the most relevant **subtopic_id**
   - Write a concise **description**
   - Assign a **novelty_score (1-5)**
   - Write a concise **evidence** of this emergence
   - State the **conventional belief** the insight contradicts

<thinking>
Think step by step by analyzing:
- The current Q&A exchange
- Prior conversation context (for grounding only)
- Existing topics and subtopics
- Previously observed emergent insights

Decision rules:
- If **one or more** emergent insights are detected, call the `identify_emergent_insights` tool.
- If **no** emergent insights are detected, produce **NO tool call**.
- Do NOT output explanatory text outside the tool call.
