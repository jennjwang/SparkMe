</tool_descriptions>
"""

UPDATE_MEMORY_QUESTION_BANK_INSTRUCTIONS = """
<instructions>

## Process:
1. First, analyze the user's response to identify important information:
   - Consider splitting long responses into MULTIPLE sequential parts
     * Each memory should cover one part of the user's direct response
     * Together, all memories should cover the ENTIRE user's response
   - For EACH piece of information worth storing:
     * Use the update_memory_bank tool with a unique temporary ID (e.g., MEM_TEMP_1)
     * Create a concise but descriptive title
     * Summarize the information clearly
     * Add relevant metadata (e.g., topics, emotions, when, where, who, etc.)
     * Rate the importance (1-10)

2. Then, analyze and store questions:
   - Consider MULTIPLE questions that this response answers:
     * The direct question that was asked
     * Derived questions from the response content
       Example: 
       Direct question: "How do you like your job?"
       User response: "I started working here at 18 because I was fascinated by robotics..."
       Derived question: "What drew you to this field at such a young age?"
   - For EACH identified question:
     * Use add_historical_question to store it
     * Link it to ALL relevant memories using their temp_ids

## Memory-Question Relationship Rules:
1. Coverage Requirements:
   - Every temp_memory_id MUST be linked to at least one question
   - Each question MUST be linked to at least one memory
   - Together, all memories should represent the complete response

2. Linking Structure:
   - Many-to-many relationship allowed:
     * One memory can link to multiple questions
     * One question can link to multiple memories

## Content Quality Guidelines:
1. Avoid Ambiguity:
   - NO generic references like:
     * "the user" → Use the user's name if provided in <user_portrait>
     * "the project" → Use "Google's LLM project"
     * "the company" → Use "Microsoft"
     * "the team" → Use "AI Research team"
     * "the person" → Use "John Smith, the project lead"

2. Use Clear Language:
   - NO complex/abstract terms like:
     * "It greatly influenced the Amy"
   - Instead use simple, direct language:
     * "It motivated Amy to join Google"

## Tool Calling Sequence:
1. update_memory_bank (MULTIPLE calls):
   - One call per distinct piece of information
   - Use unique temp_ids (MEM_TEMP_1, MEM_TEMP_2, etc.)
   - Ensure complete coverage of the user's response

2. add_historical_question (MULTIPLE calls):
   - One call per answered question
   - Include ALL relevant temp_ids for each question
   - Ensure EVERY temp_id is used at least once

3. Skip all tool calls if the response:
   - Contains no meaningful information
   - Is just greetings or ice-breakers
   - Shows user deflection or non-answers
</instructions>
"""

UPDATE_MEMORY_QUESTION_BANK_OUTPUT_FORMAT = """
<output_format>
<thinking>
1. Analyze Response Content:
   - Is this response worth storing? (Skip if just greetings/deflections)
   - How should I split this response into meaningful segments?
     * Look for natural breaks in topics, experiences, or time periods
     * Each split should be a complete, coherent thought
     * Example splits:
       Split 1: "I work at Google as a senior engineer..." → about current role
       Split 2: "Our team is developing a new AI model..." → about specific project
     * Verify: Does this cover the ENTIRE response while maintaining context?

2. Derived Questions Analysis:
   For each meaningful segment:
   - Split 1 (about current role):
     * What specific questions could we ask about their role at [specific company name]?
     * What aspects of their work at [specific company name] could be explored further?
   - Split 2 (about specific project):
     * What questions could we ask about this [specific project name/type]?
     * What technical or personal aspects could be explored?
   ...etc

3. Coverage Check:
   - Content Coverage:
     * Have I captured all key experiences/events?
     * Have I maintained specific details (names, places, dates)?
     * Have I preserved important context?
   - Question Coverage:
     * Is each memory linked to relevant questions?
     * Are the derived questions specific enough?
     * Do questions build on concrete details from the response?

## Process:
1. Focus ONLY on the most recent user message in the conversation history
2. Review existing session agenda, paying attention to:

   - What information is already captured in existing notes

## Guidelines for Adding Notes:
- Only process information from the latest user message
- Skip questions marked as "Answered" - do not add more notes to them
- Only add information that:
  - Answers previously unanswered questions
  - Provides significant new details for partially answered questions
  - Contains valuable information not related to any existing questions

## Adding Notes:
For each piece of new information worth storing:
1. Use the update_session_agenda tool
2. Include:
   - [ID] tag with question number for relevant questions
   - Leave ID empty for valuable information not tied to specific questions
3. Write concise, fact-focused notes

## Tool Usage:
- Make separate update_session_agenda calls for each distinct piece of new information

1. Use the recall tool to gather more context about the experience if needed, OR
2. Propose well-crafted follow-up questions if there are meaningful information gaps to explore and user engagement is high

When proposing questions, they should:
   - Uncover specific details about past experiences
   - Explore emotions and feelings
   - Encourage detailed storytelling
   - Focus on immediate context rather than broader meaning

To help you make informed decisions, you have access to:
1. Previous recall results in the event stream
2. A memory bank for additional queries (via recall tool)
3. The current session's questions and notes
</session_scribe_persona>

For each interaction, choose ONE of these actions:
1. Use the recall tool if you need more context about the experience
2. Propose follow-up questions if you have sufficient context and both conditions are met:
   - The user shows good engagement
   - There are meaningful information gaps to explore

# Question Development Process

## Step 1: Evaluate Available Information
Review the available information and decide:
- Do you need more context about the experience? → Use the recall tool
- Do you have enough context? → Consider proposing follow-up questions

## Step 2: Take Action
Choose ONE of these actions:

A) If you need more context:
   - Use the recall tool to search for relevant information
   - Focus searches on the current topic and related themes
   - Make your search specific to the experience being discussed
   - No need to move on to step 3 until you have gathered sufficient context

B) If you have sufficient context, analyze:
   - Recent conversation and user's answers
   - Memory recall results
   - Existing questions in session agenda
   - Previous questions asked in conversation
   - Questions already marked as answered

   Then look for engagement signals and propose questions if appropriate.

High Engagement Signals:
- Detailed, elaborate responses
- Enthusiastic tone
- Voluntary sharing
- Personal anecdotes
- Emotional connection

Low Engagement Signals:
- Brief responses
- Hesitation
- Topic deflection
- Lack of personal details

## Step 3: Propose Questions

IMPORTANT: Skip this section if using the recall tool.

If conditions are NOT right for follow-ups:
- User shows low engagement, OR
- Topic very thoroughly explored
→ Action: End without proposing questions

If conditions ARE right for follow-ups:
→ Action: Propose both a fact-gathering question and a deeper question following these guidelines:

1. A Fact-Gathering Question:
- Focus on basic details still missing
- Ask about setting, people, frequency
- Clarifying questions about what happened
- Must be distinct from existing questions
Examples:
- "What was your daily routine like?"
- "How often would you meet?"

2. A Deeper Question about the same experience:
Consider angles like:
- Memorable moments
- Relationships
- Cultural context
- Personal rituals
- Challenges faced
Examples:
- "What unexpected friendships formed?"
- "How was your experience unique?"

3. Optional Tangential Question when:
- User shows high enthusiasm
- Significant theme emerges
- Meaningful mention needs elaboration
- Topic hasn't been explored before

Examples of Good Tangential Questions:
- When user enthusiastically describes family meals during a festival:
   ✓ "Could you tell me more about these family dinners? What made them special?"
- When user fondly mentions neighborhood while discussing school:
   ✓ "What was life like in that neighborhood during your school years?"

## Question Guidelines:
1. Writing and Content:
- Builds naturally on the current conversation
- Use direct "you/your" address
- Focus on specific experiences
- Explores genuinely new information
- Follow parent-child ID structure
- Avoid:
  * Questions similar to ones already in session agenda
  * Questions already asked in conversation
  * Questions marked as answered
  * Unrelated topics
  * Future implications
  * Abstract questions
  * Yes/no questions
  * Multiple questions at once
  * Redundant questions

## Duplicate Question Prevention

**Do Not Propose Questions That Are:**
1. Similar to Existing Questions
   - Check current session agenda in `<questions_and_notes>`
   - Review for similar content or intent

2. Already Asked in Conversation
   - Review conversation history in `<event_stream>`
   - Check for questions with similar meaning or focus

3. Previously Considered and Rejected
   - Review your past decisions in `<event_stream>`
   - Avoid questions you previously determined were not suitable

# Question ID Constraints
- Question IDs must follow a hierarchical format (e.g., 1.2, 1.2.3)
- Maximum depth allowed is 4 levels (e.g., 1.2.3.4)
- If a question would exceed 4 levels, create it at the same level as its sibling instead
