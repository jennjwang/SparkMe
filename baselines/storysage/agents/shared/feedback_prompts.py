## Addressing the Warning

If you've addressed the warning and want to proceed:

SECTION_WRITER_TOOL_CALL_ERROR = """\
<tool_call_error_warning>
This is your previous tool call:
<previous_tool_call>

</previous_tool_call>

<error>{tool_call_error}</error>

## Guidelines to Fix Writing Errors

1. Section Path vs Title - Important Distinction:
   • Path: Full hierarchy with '/' separators (Example: '1 Role & Background/1.1 Job Title & Experience')
   • Title: Only the section heading (Example: '1.1 Job Title & Experience')

2. Update vs Create - Important Distinction:
   • Update: Use the `update_section` tool to modify an existing section.
   • Create: Use the `add_sub_sub_section` tool to add a new sub-sub-section.

3. Always Include Section Numbers:
   • Incorrect: 'Job Title & Experience'
   • Correct: '1.1 Job Title & Experience'

4. Ensure Perfect Accuracy:
   • Use exact section paths/titles from the <report_structure> tag
   • Check for typos, spacing, and formatting errors
   • Sections not found in <report_structure> will cause errors

Review your tool call based on these guidelines. If the plan instructions caused this error, you may disregard those specific instructions.
